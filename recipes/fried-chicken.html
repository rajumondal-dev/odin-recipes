        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Fried chicken is a crispy, golden-brown delight made by marinating chicken in buttermilk, coating it in seasoned flour, and deep-frying until crunchy outside and juicy inside. Loved worldwide, it's flavorful, satisfying, and often served with sides like fries or coleslaw, making it a favorite comfort food for many.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 kg chicken pieces (bone-in, skin-on recommended)</li>
            <li>2 cups buttermilk </li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Rinse and pat dry the chicken pieces with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Optionally, lightly score thick pieces to help cook evenly.</li>
            <li>Place chicken in a bowl or ziplock bag.</li>
            <li>Pour in buttermilk to cover all pieces.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (preferably overnight).</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix flour, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from buttermilk (let excess drip off).</li>
            <li>Dredge each piece thoroughly in the seasoned flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Press flour into the chicken to make a thick, even coating.</li>
            <li>Place coated chicken on a tray and let it rest for 15–20 minutes.</li>
            <li>This helps the coating stick better during frying.</li>
            <li>Pour oil into a deep pot or skillet (enough to submerge chicken halfway).</li>
            <li>Heat oil to 170–180°C (340–360°F). Use a thermometer if possible.</li>
            <li>Carefully place chicken pieces in hot oil (don’t overcrowd).</li>
            <li>Fry in batches for 12–15 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Internal temperature should reach 75°C (165°F).</li>
            <li>Transfer fried chicken to a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Let rest for 5–10 minutes so juices redistribute.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce, fries, coleslaw, or biscuits.</li>
        </ol>
